# Chinese-American Pork Stir-fry

A classic stir-fry with an American twist (for two)

##

This is a recipe I came up with while trying to mix Chinese style stir-fry ingredients like pork, cabbage and carrots, with a more american style sauce.

Though this recipe uses pork, it can be easily substituted with chicken or beef. Make sure to use a cut of meat that is tender enough to be stir-fried, substitute for pork 1:1.

## Ingredients

- 450 grams pork (loin or tenderloin)
- 1/2 nappa cabbage 
- 1/2 carrot
- 3 green onions
- 2 cloves garlic
- 2 teaspoons ginger (same amount as the garlic)
- 1 thai chili pepper (or as much as you'd like)
#### Sauce

- 2 tablespoons chicken stock
- 1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 1 tablespoon cooking wine
- 1 teaspoon sesame oil
- 2 teaspoons sugar
- 2 teaspoons corn Starch

## Directions

1. Cut your pork into thin strips, making sure to try to keep the size uniform. Put your pork into a slurry of 1 teaspoon of baking soda and 1/2 cup water, and leave for 15 minutes.
2. Shred your cabbage and julienne your carrots. Cut your green onions into two, separating the green and white parts. Cut the green parts into 5 cm strips.
3. Mince your garlic and ginger, and cut your chili pepper into thin slices. Take the white parts of your green onions and cut into fine slices. Combine and set aside.
4. Mix together your chicken stock, rice wine vinegar, soy sauce, cooking wine, sesame oil, sugar and corn starch. Set aside.
5. Drain your pork and pat dry. Heat up a wok or large pan on high heat, and add oil. Once the oil is hot, add your pork and stir fry until the pork is cooked through. Remove the pork from the pan and set aside.
6. Add more oil to the pan, keeping the heat on high. Add cabbage, carrots and green onions, and stir fry until your veggies are slightly charred.
7. Add aromatics and stir fry until fragrant, making sure to not burn the garlic.
8. Add your pork back to the pan, and add your sauce. Stir fry until the sauce has thickened.
