## Ingredients

- 500 grams tuna or salmon
- 1 avocado
- 1 green onion
- 1/2 cup edamame
- 4 radishes
- 2 sheets of dried seaweed
  
#### Marinade

- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 thai chili pepper
- 1 and 1/2 tablespoon oyster sauce (23 grams)
- 2 tablespoons soy sauce (30 grams)
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice (14 grams)
- 1 tablespoon cooking wine (18 grams)
- 1 and 1/2 teaspoon seseme oil (7 grams)

## Directions

1. Mince garlic and chop thai chili finely. Combine with the oyster sauce, soy sauce, lemon juice, cooking wine and seseme oil. Mix in a bowl and set aside.
2. Cut your fish into even cubes, making sure to use a sharp knife and use single strokes to minimize crushing. Place cut pieces into the marinade bowl and leave in the fridge to marinade for 30 minutes to a day.
3. Cook jasmine rice as you'd like, and set aside to cool.
4. Cut your avocado into slices by cutting it in half, and scooping the insides out with a spoon, making sure to keep the inside intact. Then, place the avocado on a cutting board and slice thinly with a knife. Once sliced, press gently overtop with the knife to fan out. Squeeze a little lemon on top to stop browning, and put aside.
5. Cook edamame and set aside. Slice radishes and the green part of the green onion thinly. Set aside.
6. Plate by filling a bowl with your cooled rice, then add your marinated fish and your vegetables. If any sauce is left in the marinade bowl, drizzle on top of the fish. Garnish with dried seaweed.
