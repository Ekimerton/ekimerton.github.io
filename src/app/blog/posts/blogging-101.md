Creating engaging blog content is crucial for any professional portfolio. In the 10X Portfolio, we simplify this process by allowing you to manage your blog posts directly through Markdown files. This post will walk you through how to create your first blog post.

## Create Your Markdown File

Start by navigating to your project's `src/blog/posts/` directory. Here, you can create a new Markdown file. The name of this file will be used as part of the static routing, so name it appropriately for your post's subject.

For instance, if you want to write a post about the basics of React, you might name your file `react-basics.md`. This article will then be accessable from `your-website.com/blog/react-basics`.

## Write Your Post
