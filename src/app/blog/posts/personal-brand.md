The job market for tech is rough right now. If you’re not getting interviews and are choosing to fill your free time with Leetcode, stop that right now. Build projects and show them off. A portfolio is the easiest way to do that, and posting them on Twitter is even better.

## Stop Grinding, Start Building

Right now, companies are being cautious. They want engineers with real experience, who can start generating value right away. A portfolio filled with projects that show you can actually build things is a much stronger signal than a bunch of solved Leetcode problems.

If you don’t have a job, don’t waste time grinding Leetcode all day. Instead, focus on creating projects. Pick something you’re interested in or a problem you want to solve, and build it. Once you’ve got a few solid projects, put them in a portfolio. This doesn’t have to be anything fancy—just something that shows what you’ve done and what you’re capable of. Don’t make another to-do list. Sit down and find something that you would personally like to use, and make that.

When your portfolio is ready, start getting your work out there. Share it on Twitter, post about it on LinkedIn, and make sure it’s easy for people to find. The goal is to get your projects in front of as many eyes as possible.
