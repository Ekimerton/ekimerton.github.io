      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I&apos;m a software engineer who loves to solve puzzles
        and build cool stuff. This website is a little look into my world - my
        projects, my love for tech, and a bit about what I do when I&apos;m not
        coding. Hope you find it interesting!
      </p>
      <h2>For Recruiters</h2>
      <p>
        Glad you stopped by. I&apos;m a software engineer with a diverse
        background and a passion for building impactful solutions. Currently,
        I&apos;m at Cachelan, where I develop software for solar sites. In the
        past, I&apos;ve contributed to enhancing user experiences at Shopify,
        worked on full-stack development at my own venture, Tinyshed, and
        handled data engineering at Wayfair. This varied experience has equipped
        me to confidently tackle front-end, back-end, and data engineering
        tasks. You can learn more about my journey in my resume. Feel free to
        check out my LinkedIn and GitHub. Reach out if you see a potential fit
        or just want to chat. I&apos;m always ready for new opportunities and
        challenges.
      </p>
