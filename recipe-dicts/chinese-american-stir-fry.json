  "intro": [
    "This is a recipe I came up with while trying to mix Chinese style stir-fry ingredients like pork, cabbage and carrots, with a more american style sauce.",
    "Though this recipe uses pork, it can be easily substituted with chicken or beef. Make sure to use a cut of meat that is tender enough to be stir-fried, substitute for pork 1:1."
